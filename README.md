## See the internal [distribution](https://github.com/kuubson/online-library/tree/master/apps/native#-distribution) flow

> **Note** Internal distribution does not involve Google Play store either App Store

When **CircleCI** finishes the build workflow, it creates a new github release with an APK file (and IPA coming soon) attached to the source code

The app can be then distirbuted internally by providing links to these files (see web app [home](https://online-library-application.herokuapp.com/) page)
